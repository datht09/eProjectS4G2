'The new frontiers of Vietnam’s premier chat app: VNG’s Zalo',
'But Zalo has emerged as a serious market leader in a year. Last time we checked, Viber was leading with 12 million total registered users and Zalo claimed to have 10 million monthly active users. But it’s possible Viber is falling behind, since VNG stated it hit the 12 million registered mark. In other words, it’s possible that Zalo is now the leading chat app on the market. For VNG however, Zalo’s success is make or break. VNG must secure the mobile market in order to remain relevant in the next decade of Vietnam’s consumer tech development. Back in February, Zalo was on par with its foreign competitors in terms of technology. In fact, it offered some features that no other foreign competitors had, like sending doodles, word guessing games, and animated emoticons. But Zalo was a bit behind design-wise. The iPhone icon wasn’t Retina yet and aesthetically it did not match up to apps like Line and Whatsapp, which look very sleek. But that didn’t matter to Vietnamese users. In many ways the Korean and Japanese (KakaoTalk and Line) counterparts didn’t understand Vietnam’s local market enough to compete significantly with VNG, nor were they willing to spend as much on marketing.',
'Back in February last year, Vietnam’s biggest consumer tech company VNG made a consumer push for its new chat app Zalo. From then until now, Zalo grew at a breakneck pace and was on track to become Vietnam’s top chat app. At the time, it was arguably behind international competitors like Viber, Line, KakaoTalk, and others.',

'Tech in Asia Arena goes to Ho Chi Minh city: pitching and learn how to scale in Southeast Asia',
'We are privileged to have Kuo-Yi Lim (managing director at Monk’s Hill Ventures) and Khor Chieh Suang (principal at Digital Media Partners) to sit with us for an intimate chat for the first half of the event. Both firms are headquartered in Singapore and include investors who are veterans in the technology startup space, having worked on international companies and deals across the US and Asia. Monk’s Hill Ventures is a new US$80 million fund targeted at technology startups from Southeast Asia, and Silicon Valley companies expanding into Asia. It is run by serial entrepreneurs and investors who have been behind Match.com, Interwoven, Bubbly, and Infocomm Investments. Meanwhile, Digital Media Partners has invested in many Southeast Asia-born and Southeast Asia-focused companies over the last several years, including 2C2P, Adz, Mig.me, and NhomMua. I will be chatting with both Kuo-Yi and Chieh Suang. Kuo-Yi will share his experience of being involved in startups that scaled successfully (Encentuate, acquired by IBM; Reputation Technologies, acquired by Security Sources), and having to transition to leading Infocomm Investments, a US$200 million fund investing in technology startups globally. For Chieh Suang, I will be looking to seek out learnings from her 10 years of investing experience in Southeast Asia (EDB Investments, Infocomm Investments, Nusantara Ventures and now Digital Media Partners). Her deep experience in looking at deals in emerging Southeast Asia will give us much opportunity to compare the similarities and differences in growing companies in Vietnam versus Indonesia versus Thailand, for example. The second part of the event gets interesting in a very different way. We are looking for five startups who want this fantastic opportunity to pitch to both Monk’s Hill Ventures and Digital Media Partners (DMP). Monk’s Hill invests between US$1 to 5 million in each deal, and DMP invests between US$0.5 to 1 million per deal and may follow-up with US$3 million if the company expands. This pitch will be conducted live in front of everyone. The format involves a five-minute pitch and five-minute Q&A from Kuo-Yi and Chieh Suang. We are looking for five promising startups to take the stage. Language: English (live subtitling in Vietnamese) Agenda: 6:30pm-7:00pm: Registration 7:00pm-7:05pm: Welcome by Tech in Asia 7:05pm-7:45pm: Fireside Chat with Kuo-Yi Lim (Managing Director at Monk’s Hill Ventures) and Khor Chieh Suang (Principal at Digital Media Partners) 7:45pm-830pm: Pitches by 5 companies (5 mins pitch, 5 mins Q&A) 8:30pm-9:00pm: Networking Venue: Block D, Thong Tan Xa Viet Nam, 116-118 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, Quận 3, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam',
'If you’re an entrepreneur in Vietnam working on the next big thing, we want to hear from you. Our next event in Ho Chi Minh city on Tuesday 22 July from 630pm-9pm will be investment-focused. Through a panel discussion, startups can learn from seasoned investors – what they look out for, how to regionalize, globalize and scale your startup, and maybe why you should not expand regionally. Startups will also have the opportunity to pitch to these investors live on the Tech in Asia Arena battlefield. Register here to attend, and submit this additional form for a chance to pitch on stage.',

'Why online booking is Vietnam’s next tech startup frontier',
'Gaming is felt most profoundly with two companies: VNG and dotGEARS. VNG is Vietnam’s premier startup with a revenue of US$100 million last year. It has built an empire from distributing games. DotGEARS is the company behind Flappy Bird, one of the most viral mobile games of 2014. Meanwhile, investors have been focusing on ecommerce in the last few years as they see it as the next wave of Vietnam’s retail industry. Massive companies like Vingroup even promised to dump over US$30 million into an ecommerce division that seeks to replicate Alibaba in Vietnam. Finally, with the country’s explosive smartphone growth, it is likely that it will hit 30 million smartphone users early next year. This means mobile is a key area that is fresh and desperately in need of startups. It’s no wonder Appota recently got Series B funding to tackle mobile. Gaming, ecommerce, and mobile are where everyone in the ecosystem is watching, but I think the fourth wave is booking. Here’s why. Why are booking startups next? Basically, booking is a natural extension of ecommerce. It solves all the same problems that ecommerce does: curation, trust, payment, and inventory. But it sells services instead of products. And although most of the services cater towards Vietnam’s growing middle class, a handful of the startups in the booking category are growing or financially stable. With ecommerce, the startups are different based on their industries like groceries or fashion, but their key differentiation is in their model, such as B2C or C2C or even businesses that do both online and offline retail simultaneously. On the other hand, booking startups differentiate on industry, like travel or transportation. Generally, booking is a B2B2C business, which relies heavily on sales and customer service. Each booking startup must develop strong relationships with service providers in order to function. For example, Ticketbox must have good business relationships with event organizers. The key here is service providers do not have strong distribution channels nor are they equipped to harness the power of the internet as they have to focus on the brick-and-mortar of their businesses. Booking startups give them a way to expand online. What are booking startups, and who are they? Essentially, to book is to reserve something online. This reservation could apply to tickets, events, travel, transport, and more. In the past year, this category has exploded with new startups and tech businesses. In the travel category, this includes folks like Ivivu.com, Mytour.vn, Triip.me, Chudu24, and Yesgo.vn. They specialize in booking hotels, tours, and even plane flights. In the transport category, we have startups include Vexere.com, Baolau.vn, GrabTaxi, Uber, and EasyTaxi. In a country where logistics is a major issue, transportation is a key category that needs disruption. Booking cars, taxis, buses, airplane flights, and trains is cumbersome and fragmented. Most of the time, customers book transportation over the phone. In the events category, there are now multiple startups ferociously competing like Ticketbox.vn, VNTIC.vn, Sukien.io, Citynetevents.com, and Sukiennet.vn. Some may say this is such a small market but there are potential avenues for growth in the entertainment, listings, and education areas. Some of these startups have reached revenues up to five or six figures in US dollars per month. Although these guys represent the vanguard, there’s also other unexplored spaces like restaurant booking, which Foody.vn may be entering into. Clearly, Vietnam has plenty of unexplored frontiers for startups. And although bookings is not particularly sexy compared to chat apps or wearable technology, it shows that there is still considerable space for new tech innovation in Vietnam.

'Why did FPT just buy VNG’s dead ecommerce site for $500,000? ',
'In a recent move, FPT, via its ecommerce platform Sendo.vn, acquired VNG’s defunct estore 123mua for US$250,000. This appears to be a rather bizarre move, since 123mua has been out of commission since it shut down in December. There are several possible reasons for the acquisition. It’s possible Sendo.vn wants access to 123mua’s traffic, merchants, email database, and most importantly, insight into the classifieds business. At a pricetag of US$500,000 it’s not acquiring a full fledged business. It’s not likely that the 123mua site will keep running. Rumors in the ecommerce ecosystem are that Sendo.vn only has about 1,000 to 2,000 deliveries per day. This is dwarfed by group buying sites like CungMua and Hotdeal, which get up to 8,000 deliveries per day on average. Even Giao Hang Nhanh, Vietnam’s premier logistics ecommerce service delivers over 6,000 per day. For folks like CungMua (which also recently acquired NhomMua), each both have in their databases over two million accounts that have actually bought something online. Other companies that are ranked as highly as CungMua or NhomMua, like Lazada, likely have similar numbers of accounts. The point here is that with each ecommerce site with its own separate database and number of accountable users, they each have marketed and acquired a percentage of the total people in Vietnam that are willing to buy something online. This is extremely valuable for a frontier market like Vietnam, where building trust and acquiring a new customer that would like to buy something online is costly and time consuming. Sendo.vn’s acquisition of 123mua can be seen as further consolidation of the ecommerce market. Editing by J.T. Quigley',
'Back in December last year, we reported that VNG, Vietnam’s top consumer technology company, had quietly closed up its ecommerce site. It is possible that VNG couldn’t handle the margins that came along with an ecommerce business (which usually sit around five percent or less) – especially since VNG’s margins, for its core business of gaming distribution, are likely between 10 and 30 percent. When it folded, it distributed its staff throughout the rest of VNG and closed down the 123mua offices. In the meantime, FPT, Vietnam’s tech juggernaut (it has business licenses in everything from outsourcing to telco to education) has continued its B2B2C ecommerce site, Sendo.vn. The company even playfully announced that it’d be pursuing drone technology just like Amazon for delivering ecommerce goods.',

'Uber finally arrives in Vietnam, a country that needs a major logistics overhaul',
'Ho Chi Minh City is interesting because it is dominated by two major taxi companies: Mai Linh and Vinasun. In the past five to ten years, these two companies have flooded the city with their green branding and more reliable services than their smaller competitors. Uber will face resistance from these two incumbents whose drivers are also increasingly using two of Uber’s local taxi app competitors: GrabTaxi and EasyTaxi. Although the numbers cannot be verified definitively, some in the startup ecosystem believe that GrabTaxi is doing better than Easy Taxi as it has been executing a better discount and marketing strategy across Vietnam’s two major cities. Now, the Malaysian upstart will have to contend with Uber’s unique marketing techniques. As Uber’s press release outlines, it’s playfully matched up with local Vietnamese celebrities for the extra boost on the day of the launch: Actresses Hong Anh and Chi Pu, singer Hoang Thuy Linh, and blogger Nicky Khanh Ngoc were the first to jump at the chance to try Uber out for a ride on the town. They downloaded the Uber app, and within 10 minutes, a luxurious Uber was able to whisk them away to a movie set, a recording studio, and a photo shoot. We’ll let you figure out who went where. We’ll likely see more of this, just like how Uber offered lion dances in China and Singapore for Lunar New Year. What does Uber’s potential market look like? The US$17 billion company expanded to over 100 countries worldwide, but the bulk of its revenues come from just five cities. In other words, Uber is clearly playing a very long-term game: it wants to get a foothold before its clones get too powerful. It has a long road ahead. Uber will face pushback from local taxi companies as well as encounter cultural quirks. Cities like Ho Chi Minh have peculiar luxury car cultures. Most luxury black cars of the BMW and Mercedes variety are owned by the upper middle class and rich people of the big city. They own the cars but hire the drivers. These owners may not allow their drivers to make extra money on the side. Yet Vietnam sorely needs logistical support, and Uber can help. Already, companies like Giao Hang Nhanh have grown to fill the holes, and companies like Lazada, The Gioi Di Dong, Tiki.vn, and others have invested heavily on their own logistics fleets. If Uber founder Travis Kalanik’s vision is really to bring Uber into other logistics categories like ice-cream delivery and flowers, the Vietnamese will welcome them with open arms. Ho Chi Minh City and Ha Noi, the nation’s capital, both lack a train system despite desperately needing one. Again, Uber, GrabTaxi, and Easy Taxi are all easing that burden. Editing by Terence Lee ',
'Most people in Vietnam never thought it would happen, but it has: Uber has arrived in the country today. The luxury transportation startup arrived in Bangkok in February, Beijing in April, and Jakarta in June. Now it’ll reach Ho Chi Minh City in July. Uber’s on track to roll out monthly in every major city across Asia.',

'Bet against your Facebook friends on this year’s World Cup with the help of Sepp.com',

He’s loved soccer ever since he was a kid, so Sepp.com was a natural pet project for the team to take on for the last few months in the runner up to the World Cup after resigning from VC Corp. The basic premise of the product is that you can bet on the next ten games at the World Cup. Depending on whether your team wins, loses, or draws, you’ll gain (or lose) points. The point system will determine if you are good at predicting matches or not. The main point is that you get to challenge your friends and colleagues without the risk of losing money on a real gamble. Up til now, Palm and Vu have been focused on building products for the local Vietnamese market. That includes Eat.vn and other web services like Expat.vn, which provides services to expats living in Vietnam. Sepp.com is their first effort into the global market: I found that soccer is one of the best connectors of people in the world and I wanted to build my first startup targeting a global audience. I’ve always played soccer games online to stay in touch with friends back home, but these have been local Swedish games. I wanted to build something where people could compete with soccer prediction skills independent of which language they speak and where they are located. Palm hopes that the World Cup will only be the first launch – additional matches, perhaps even full seasons, from a variety of international leagues will be added in the future. The World Cup provides a clear format of ten matches each week, but this will be updated to fit the intricacies of other leagues. Palm is looking to monetize Sepp.com with advertisements and sponsorships just like other soccer-related products. Eventually, he may add some kind of real gambling component that puts actual money at stake. Our mission is to become the de facto standard measurement for how good you are at predicting soccer. The Sepp score ranges from zero to 100 and is based on how well you predict matches week by week, everyone starts at 50. It is a bit like Klout for soccer predictions. So far, the platform has over 1,000 users hailing from 24 countries since a soft launch on the week of the World Cup. The company is also looking at improving the mobile side, anticipating that people will use their mobile as a second screen while watching the game.',
'If you’re like some of us at Tech In Asia, you’re staying up late into the night (or early morning) to catch a glimpse of amazing goals from folks like the now infamous Robin Van Persie. In the midst of this year’s World Cup, global tech companies are finding ways to capitalize on soccer fever. Facebook featured last night’s matches on its new Trending feature, Twitter has dedicated a hashtag and column, and even Google’s been sporting a World Cup doodle.
